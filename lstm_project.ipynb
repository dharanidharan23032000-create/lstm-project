        "2.  Disabling `tf.data` debug mode using `tf.data.experimental.disable_debug_mode()` after all Keras model training.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The synthetic multivariate time series dataset, mimicking industrial sensor data, was successfully generated and processed into sequential windows for LSTM model training. The dataset contained 1969 samples after windowing, with a sequence length of 30 and 5 features.\n",
        "*   Hyperparameter tuning identified the best LSTM model configuration, which was subsequently retrained on a combined training and validation set.\n",
        "*   The final LSTM model achieved strong performance on the held-out test set, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2587, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.3168, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 13.56%.\n",
        "*   SHAP explainability revealed the global feature importance: \"sensor\\_1\" was the most important feature, followed by \"sensor\\_2\", \"sensor\\_3\", \"sensor\\_5\", and \"sensor\\_4\" (in descending order of importance).\n",
        "*   Analysis of time-step importance showed that recent time steps in the input window (those closer to the prediction point) generally contributed more to the model's predictions than older time steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The successful toggling of eager execution settings provides a robust pattern for integrating TensorFlow 2.x Keras models with TensorFlow 1.x-dependent explainability tools like SHAP's DeepExplainer within the same workflow.\n",
        "*   The SHAP insights into feature and time-step importance can guide future model improvements, such as feature selection or designing attention mechanisms that prioritize more recent or important features.\n"
